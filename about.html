  <h1>About the ISM Game</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What is the Game?</h2>
    <p>
      The ISM (Information Security Management) Game is an interactive decision-making simulation designed to help you explore the complexities of managing security within an organisation. You take on the role of an information security lead and make a series of choices that impact your organisation's success across various dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each scenario presents a realistic challenge or policy decision. Your responses influence four key metrics, reflecting the trade-offs and pressures security professionals often face.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Understanding the Metrics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Budget üí∞</strong>: Represents your organisation‚Äôs financial resources. Some choices cost money, while others might help preserve or even improve your budget.</li>
      <li><strong>Reputation ‚≠ê</strong>: Reflects external trust and brand image. It‚Äôs influenced by transparency, compliance, and public response to your decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Security üîê</strong>: Tracks how resilient and well-protected your organisation is against threats. Security-focused choices tend to boost this, though often at other costs.</li>
      <li><strong>Morale üòä</strong>: Measures internal staff satisfaction and cultural wellbeing. Overly strict or unpopular policies may reduce morale, even if effective.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>
      You'll be presented with scenarios and asked to select one of several policy options. Each option affects the organisation differently. After each choice, you'll see the outcome and changes to your metrics. At the end of the game, you can review your decision log or replay to explore alternative strategies.
